India, the world's second-largest producer of fruits and vegetables, experiences significant post-harvest losses, with up to 16% wastage due to a lack of processing facilities. The shortage of cold storage, particularly in rural areas with unreliable power, leads to economic losses. Solar-powered cold storage presents a promising solution. In Uttar pradesh aligarh district, a 10 MT capacity system could be sustained by 120 square meters of solar collectors, reducing post-harvest losses. This study highlights the potential of solar energy in addressing agricultural challenges.
